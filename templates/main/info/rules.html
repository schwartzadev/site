                <p>
                    We have a small but strict set of rules on our server. Please read over them and take them on board -
                    if you don't understand anything or need some clarification, feel free to ask any staff member!
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Be polite, and do not spam
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Follow the <a href="https://discordapp.com/guidelines">Discord community guidelines</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be patient both with users asking questions, and the users answering them
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Listen to and respect the staff members - we're here to help, but we're all human beings
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        All discussion should be kept within the relevant channels for the subject.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                General Python help and support requests go to one of the three help channels - pick
                                the one that is the quietest at the time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The topical channels can be used for help and support requests, but general discussion
                                about the subjects covered by them should go there also.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you're working with one of the bots, we ask you to specifically do that in
                                <code>#bot-commands</code>, to keep the other channels clear of bot output.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you're working on a Python project or something directly related to our server, feel
                                free to post a link to it in <code>#show-your-projects</code>. We prefer links to source
                                code over websites, but we'll also accept screenshots and videos if you're not yet ready
                                to release the code.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        If you or someone else posts a project to <code>#show-your-projects</code>, you may
                                        discuss it in <code>#show-your-projects-discussion</code>. <code>#show-your-projects</code>
                                        is intended to be a listing channel, and any discussion there is removed regularly.

                    We have a generally no-nonsense policy when it comes to our rules. If you notice someone breaking
                    them, feel free to mention or DM a staff member and we'll try to deal with it as soon as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The possible actions we take based on infractions can include the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A public verbal/textual warning</li>
                    <li>A short temporary mute</li>
                    <li>A long temporary mute</li>
                    <li>A kick from the server</li>
                    <li>A temporary ban from the server</li>
                    <li>A permanent ban from the server</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    While we do discuss more serious matters internally before handing out a punishment, simpler
                    infractions are dealt with directly by individual staffers and the punishment they hand out is left
                    to their own decision-making.
