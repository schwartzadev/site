        A complicated function allowing you to follow a changefeed for a specific table

        This function will not allow you to specify a set of conditions for your changefeed, so you'll
        have to write your own query and run it with `run()` if you need that. If not, you'll just get every
        change for the specified table.

        Documents take the form of a dict with `old_val` and `new_val` fields by default. These are set to a copy of
        the document before and after the change being represented was made, respectively. The format of these dicts
        can change depending on the arguments you pass to the function, however.

        If a changefeed must be aborted (for example, if the table was deleted), a ReqlRuntimeError will be
        raised.

        Note: This function always creates a new connection. This is to prevent you from losing your changefeed
        when the connection used for a request context is closed.

        :param changefeed_queue_size: The number of changes the server will buffer between client reads before it
            starts to drop changes and issues errors - defaults to  100,000

        :param include_initial: If True, the changefeed will start with the initial values of all the documents in
            the table; the results will have `new_val` fields ONLY to start with if this is the case. Note that
            the old values may be intermixed with new changes if you're still iterating through the old values, but
            only as long as the old value for that field has already been sent. If the order of a document you've
            already seen moves it to a part of the group you haven't yet seen, an "unitial" notification is sent, which
            is simply a dict with an `old_val` field set, and not a `new_val` field set. This option defaults to
            False.

        :param include_states: Whether to send special state documents to the changefeed as its state changes. This
            comprises of special documents with only a `state` field, set to a string - the state of the feed. There
            are currently two states - "initializing" and "ready". This option defaults to False.

        :param include_types: If True, each document generated will include a `type` field which states what type
            of change the document represents. This may be "add", "remove", "change", "initial", "uninitial" or
            "state". This option defaults to False.
