class BaseView(MethodView, OauthMixin):

        """
        Render some templates and get them back in a form that you can simply return from your view function.

        Here's what's inserted:
        * "current_page" - the "name" attribute from the view class
        * "view" - the view class instance
        * "logged_in" - a boolean, True if the user is logged in
        * "static_file(filename)", a function used to get the URL for a given static file
        * "csrf_token()", a function returning the CSRF token stored in the current session

        For XSS protection, a CSRF token must be used. The "csrf_token()" function returns the correct token
        to be used in the current rendering context - if your view methods are to be protected from XSS
        exploits, the following steps must be taken:

        1. Apply the "csrf" decorator to the view method
        2. For forms, a hidden input must be declared in the template, with the name "csrf_token", and the value set to
           the CSRF token.
        3. For any AJAX work, the CSRF token should be stored in a variable, and sent as part of the request headers.
           You can set the "X-CSRFToken" header to the CSRF token for this.

        Any API call or form submission not protected by an API key must not be vulnerable to XSS, unless the API
        call is intended to be a completely public feature. Public API methods must not be account-bound, and they
        must never return information on a current user or perform any action. Only data retrieval is permissible.
