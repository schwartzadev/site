class DBMixin:
    """
    Mixin for classes that make use of RethinkDB. It can automatically create a table with the specified primary
    key using the attributes set at class-level.

    This class is intended to be mixed in alongside one of the other view classes. For example:

    >>> class MyView(APIView, DBMixin):
    ...     name = "my_view"  # Flask internal name for this route
    ...     path = "/my_view"  # Actual URL path to reach this route
    ...     table_name = "my_table"  # Name of the table to create
    ...     table_primary_key = "username"  # Primary key to set for this table

    This class will also work with Websockets:

    >>> class MyWebsocket(WS, DBMixin):
    ...     name = "my_websocket"
    ...     path = "/my_websocket"
    ...     table_name = "my_table"
    ...     table_primary_key = "username"

    You may omit `table_primary_key` and it will be defaulted to RethinkDB's default column - "id".

    Mixin for the classes that need access to a logged in user's information. This class should be used
    to grant route's access to user information, such as name, email, id, ect.

    There will almost never be a need for someone to inherit this, as BaseView does that for you.

    This class will add 3 properties to your route:

        * logged_in (bool): True if user is registered with the site, False else wise.

        * user_data (dict): A dict that looks like this:

        {
            "user_id": Their discord ID,
            "username": Their discord username (without discriminator),
            "discriminator": Their discord discriminator,
            "email": Their email, in which is connected to discord
        }

        user_data returns None, if the user isn't logged in.
